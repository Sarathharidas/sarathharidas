### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I work as a data scientist at Meta for my day job. I am passionate about experimentation and causal inference. 
- As a passion project, I built www.quicktranslates.com, a website that helps get automatic subtitles for any language pair using speech-to-text and machine translation
